# AWS Well Architected Reliability Pillar

The AWS Well-Architected Framework has been developed to help cloud architects build the most secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure possible on AWS. The framework provides a consistent approach for customers and partners to evaluate architectures and provides guidance to help implement designs that will scale over time.

The Reliability Pillar is one of six pillars that make up the AWS Well-Architected Framework. The Reliability Pillar helps you make your systems more resilient to change and failure by identifying and addressing risks before they become problems.

The Reliability Pillar has four key concepts:

1. Design for failure
1. Automate recovery
1. Test for resilience
1. Monitor for performance and availability

Each of these concepts is further explored in the Reliability Pillar section of the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

## Design for failure

The first principle of the Reliability Pillar is to design for failure. This means that you should anticipate and plan for potential problems that could occur in your system.

One way to do this is to use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Auto Scaling to automatically scale your Amazon EC2 instances up or down in response to changes in demand. This will help ensure that your system can handle sudden increases in traffic without experiencing downtime.

Another way to design for failure is to use Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to store your data in a highly available and durable manner. Amazon S3 is designed to provide 99.999999999% durability and 99.99% availability of objects stored in the service.

## Automate recovery

The second principle of the Reliability Pillar is to automate recovery. This means that you should automate the process of recovering from failures.

One way to do this is to use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor your system and automatically take action when an issue is detected. For example, you can use Amazon CloudWatch to trigger an Amazon SNS notification when an Amazon EC2 instance is down for more than five minutes.

Another way to automate recovery is to use Amazon DynamoDB to store your data in a highly available and durable manner. DynamoDB is designed to automatically replicate your data across multiple Availability Zones in an AWS Region.

## Test for resilience

The third principle of the Reliability Pillar is to test for resilience. This means that you should test your system to ensure that it can recover from failures.

One way to do this is to use Amazon CloudFormation to create a test environment that is identical to your production environment. This will allow you to test your system's ability to recover from failures without affecting your live system.

Another way to test for resilience is to use Amazon Elastic Beanstalk to deploy your applications in a highly available and scalable manner. Elastic Beanstalk is designed to automatically detect and recover from common application failures.

## Monitor for performance and availability

The fourth principle of the Reliability Pillar is to monitor performance and availability. This means that you should continuously monitor your system to ensure that it is performing and available as expected.

One way to do this is to use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor your system for performance and availability issues. CloudWatch can provide you with alerts when your system is not performing as expected.

Another way to monitor for performance and availability issues is to use Amazon CloudTrail to track changes made to your AWS resources. CloudTrail can help you identify changes that could impact the performance or availability of your system.
